Let me walk you through what's there.\n\n## Existing Branch Instructions\n\nThe CPU class implements several branch instructions as methods. Here's how they're structured:\n\n```python\ndef", "root_cause": "The system prompt explicitly states that for this user request ('can you show me the brlo implementation?'), the response should use instructive mode, not educational mode. This key evidence existed in the context but was not retrieved during response generation, resulting in a long educational resp", "repair_actions": ["Before generating, scan for explicit mode instructions in the system prompt that apply to the specific user query", "When the query matches a mode-specified scenario, default to that mode regardless of other content", "For instructive mode: provide minimal code (2-4 lines) with 1-2 sentences of guidance, no sections or extended explanations"], "time": "2026-02-19T23:52:40"}
